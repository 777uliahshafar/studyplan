\section{language study plan :Study plans to improve Korean/English language ability* required for taking a degree course before and after you come to Korea.}

Upon my arrival in korea, I would have planned as followed:

March through June
\begin{itemize}
    \item I would get used to the korean conversation through electornic media platform such as youtube, netflix and viu.
    \item I would learn the basic of korean letter (Hangeul) from 90daykorean.com which is free.
    \item I would make a journal book of my journey as a beginner of korean language study.
    \item Memorize 10-15 words of Korean vocabulary each day.
    \item Finding and Participate in korean language community in my country, this might be online community.
    \item Study for IELTS exam to increase my score and develop my academic english skills through the official book and an internet (ielts-simon.study).
\end{itemize}

If I was elected as awarde of GKS in june, I would study more and exclusively through institution courses. By the end of my course, I would dabble on taking an exam of TOPIC. After I completed all my preperation  upon the departure to Korea, I would have sufficient language to communicate in simple conversation, like in travel, grocery store and any crowd






\section{Goal of study \& Study Plan :Goal of study and detailed study plan}
\section*{Please describe your study plan for graduate study in your area of specialization. Be as specific as you can regarding your academic interests and the curriculum you expect to follow in achieving your goals.}

\section{Future Plan after Study :Future plan in Korea or another country after finishing GKS program}
\section*{Please describe your future plans or goals after graduate studies.}

In short term, I might continue living in South Korea for a while, if possible.  The chance of living in Korea would enable me to contribute more either in academic, professional, or social way. For example, I would find job opportunities there where I would work with korean and involve in some korean development. Those will give me further exposure of korean culture, education style, working style and even lifestyle that enhance my experience in korea.

In long term, I would like to continue delivering lecture in the university that has granted me further study consent. My lecture would have consisted of a mixed knowledge and experience from Korea and Indonesia. For example, I would like to present comparison of urban planning in the class spesifically in public space between the city in indonesia and korea. As result, my future student would not only understand its country architecture, but they would have wide perspective.

Beside delivering lecture, I would probably doing some research. My research topic would have discuss about urban planning topic in the developing city. For example, I would explore the strength and weakness public spaces on forming their identity between two country. The result of a number research of mine could be utilized by policy maker,planner, or even architect on figure out the problems by looking at two cases examples.

It is encouraged that lecturer do community services. I have planned to involve in community service program with student. The job of a lecture is to supervise students while doing their program. This program will benefit a place of program conducted, usually it will be in remote area.

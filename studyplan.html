<!-- l. 53 --><p class='noindent'>While I am still in my country, I would plan my Korean language study as follows:
</p><!-- l. 55 --><p class='indent'>   In March to June </p>
<ul class='itemize1'>      
<li class='itemize'>I would get used to the Korean conversation through electronic media platforms
such as Youtube, Netflix and Viu.
</li>      
<li class='itemize'>I would learn the basic of Korean letter (Hangeul) from 90daykorean.com which is
free.
</li>      
<li class='itemize'>I would make journal books of my journey as a beginner of Korean language study.
</li>      
<li class='itemize'>Memorize 10-15 words of the Korean vocabulary each day.
</li>      
<li class='itemize'>I would find and participate in Korean language communities in my country, this
might be online communities.
</li>      
<li class='itemize'>Study for the IELTS exam to increase my score and develop my academic English
skills through the official book and an internet (ielts-simon.study).</li></ul>
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
<!-- l. 65 --><p class='indent'>   If I was elected as an awardee of the Global Korea Scholarship in June, I would study more
and exclusively through an institution course. By the end of my course, I would dabble on
taking an exam of TOPIC in order to familiarize myself with the examination. After I
completing all the preparation upon the departure to Korea, I would have sufficient language
to communicate in a simple conversation, like in a travel, a grocery store and any
place.
</p><!-- l. 67 --><p class='indent'>   On my arrival in Korea, I would maximize my Korean language study in a one-year GKS’s
language program. I will follow the study curriculum in the classes and continue the study in
my dormitory until I understand the class’s objective of the day. In addition, I will be working
a Korean language out with other peers in our spare time casually. The program curriculum
must succeed us since GKS program has pass more than a hundred thousand of
applicant.
</p><!-- l. 72 --><p class='indent'>   As the language program is running, I would add some addition activities. An extra activity
would have a huge impact on my language improvement such as participating in available
organization for international students. For example, I would find and join volunteering
activities a campus surrounding. And also try as much as I can surround myself with native
Korean speakers. I can interact with them maybe in a dormitory, a park, or even outside a
library.
</p><!-- l. 75 --><p class='indent'>   Even though someday I would fluent on a daily conversation of a Korean language, my
language grade can only be examined through the topic test. It is always available to do a test
each semester. If I feel well-prepared, I will take an exam until I get the deserved score. This
score would certainly give me a confidence on pursuit a doctorate degree in the Korean
University.
</p><!-- l. 77 --><p class='indent'>   The architecture department programs in most of Korean universities use an English as a
language program. Therefore, after passing on the TOPIK exam, I would catch up on an
academic English study. I would try to take one more IELTS test in early doctorate program.
While I catch up with my English, I will always maintain my Korean language throughout the
studies.

<!-- l. 83 --><p class='noindent'>I have studied architecture maybe for almost one decade. During this period, I have
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
received diplomas from a vocational high school to a master’s degree in the architecture
program. Moreover, recently I have just found my interest on the urban planning.
Therefore, I would like to continue specifically the urban planning in the future of my
study.
</p><!-- l. 86 --><p class='indent'>   The study of the city has gained much attention from many architecture departments in the
Korean Universities. It is proven by the emergence of the variety programs that deal with city
problems. One of the example is an architecture design studio graduate program. This program
has covered urban planning issues such as the characters of architectural design which related
to my proposal research.
</p><!-- l. 88 --><p class='indent'>   In my research proposal, I would like to study about the identity of public spaces in
Parepare, specifically in coastal areas. The urbanization that took place in Parepare lately has
led to fast development. This development can cause the loss of local identity and the
emergence of standardized and homogeneous city character. Finding a strong identity of public
spaces is not only will attracts people in the city, but it will shows the good quality of
environment.
</p><!-- l. 90 --><p class='indent'>   The identity can be formed through the characters which lay inside a place. Indeed, public
spaces have various characteristics. Those characteristics explain about what is in physical and
social environments. By following architecture program in the Korean university, I would be
able to finding characteristics of an architectural design that shape the identity of public spaces
in Parepare.

<h3 class='likesectionHead'><a id='x1-60004'></a>Please describe your future plans or goals after graduate studies.</h3>
<!-- l. 97 --><p class='noindent'>In short term, I might continue living in the South Korea for a while, if possible. The chance
of living in the Korea would enable me to contribute more either in an academic,
a professional, or a social way. For example, I would find job opportunities there
where I would work with Korean citizen and involve in some Korean developments.
Those will give me further exposures of the Korean culture, the education style,
the working style and even the lifestyle that probably enhance my experience in
Korea.
</p><!-- l. 99 --><p class='indent'>   In long term, I would like to continue delivering a lecture in the university that has granted
me further study consent. My lecture would have consisted of a mixed knowledge and
experience from Korea and Indonesia. For example, I would like to present a comparison of the
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
urban planning in the class specifically in public spaces between the city in Indonesia and
Korea. As result, my future students would not only understand their country’s architecture,
but they would have wider perspective.
</p><!-- l. 101 --><p class='indent'>   Beside delivering a lecture, I would probably doing some research. My research topics would
discuss about the urban planning topic in the developing city. For example, I would explore
the strength and weakness of public spaces on forming their identity between two
countries. The result of a number research of mine could be utilized by the policy
maker,planner, or even architect on figure out the problems by looking at the two cases
examples.
</p><!-- l. 103 --><p class='indent'>   It is encouraged that lecturer do community services. I have planned to involve in the
community service programs with students. The job of a lecture is to supervise students while
doing their program. This program will benefit a serviced place, usually it will be in remote
area.
